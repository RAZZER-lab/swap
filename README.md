Zephyr Protocol: Layer 1 Achieved, Layer 2 Expansion Begins
ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations to the ZEPH Team!
Zephyr Protocolâ€™s Layer 1 is now complete
â€”a fully private, unstoppable foundation. But the journey doesnâ€™t stop here.

Why Layer 2? Bridging Privacy and Adoption
While L1 remains 100% private (the OG choice), Layer 2 is where we adapt to global infrastructure needs. 
To bring privacy to the masses, we must meet them where they are
â€”and today, that means TRON.

L1 = Absolute Privacy (For purists, unstoppable.)
L2 = Privacy + Usability (For broader adoption, integrating with systems like TRON.)

Zephyr Yield Shares (ZYS): The Next Frontier
The community is now building Layer 2 tools, starting with ZYS (Zephyr Yield Shares), designed to:
âœ… Integrate seamlessly with TRONâ€™s ecosystem.
âœ… Preserve maximal privacy where possible.
âœ… Enable yield strategies without sacrificing core ZEPH values.

GitHub: Build, test, and refine the tools.

Zephyr stays private at its core
â€”but L2 grows where the world needs it.
