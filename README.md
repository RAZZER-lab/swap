Zephyr Protocol: Layer 1 Achieved, Layer 2 Expansion Begins
üéâ Congratulations to the ZEPH Team!
Zephyr Protocol‚Äôs Layer 1 is now complete
‚Äîa fully private, unstoppable foundation. But the journey doesn‚Äôt stop here.

Why Layer 2? Bridging Privacy and Adoption
While L1 remains 100% private (the OG choice), Layer 2 is where we adapt to global infrastructure needs. 
To bring privacy to the masses, we must meet them where they are
‚Äîand today, that means TRON.

L1 = Absolute Privacy (For purists, unstoppable.)
L2 = Privacy + Usability (For broader adoption, integrating with systems like TRON.)

Zephyr Yield Shares (ZYS): The Next Frontier
The community is now building Layer 2 tools, starting with ZYS (Zephyr Yield Shares), designed to:

‚úÖ Integrate seamlessly with TRON‚Äôs ecosystem.
‚úÖ Preserve maximal privacy where possible.
‚úÖ Enable yield strategies without sacrificing core ZEPH values.

Join the Movement
Discord: Help shape L2‚Äôs future. ([Join Here](https://discord.com/invite/RaN7tKhdqA))
GitHub: Build, test, and refine the tools.

Zephyr stays private at its core
‚Äîbut L2 grows where the world needs it.

For Extra Security
#
Use a Linux VM (e.g., VirtualBox) to isolate the environment.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Testnet Only: Expect bugs.

Self-Hosting = Privacy: Avoid third-party servers.
Linux VM: Recommended to reduce OS-level leaks.
